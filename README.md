This paper introduces a Concentric Number Theory (CNT) framework that geometrically maps prime numbers onto logarithmic, concentric rings defined by powers of two. We develop a Prime Complexity Index (Cp) to quantify geometric irregularity relative to binary reference structures. Analyzing the first 500 primes, we identify significant spatial clustering patterns and reveal a stable linear relationship between prime magnitude and geometric complexity. The findings suggest underlying organizational principles in prime distribution when viewed through geometric lenses, providing new avenues for number theory research.
